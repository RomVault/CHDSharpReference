# CHDSharpReference
CHD C# simple Reference Reader 

My goal here is to produce the cleanest and the most readable possible code to document the CHD file format.

There are no confusing optimizations, and there is repeated code across the versions.
This is intentional so as to make reading and understanding the code as easy as possible.
